## Goal
High-level, I intend to further automate the Govee ecosystem.  Initially, this will just be an exploratory practice.  As I progress through the project, I might formalize my approach.

## To-do
- [X] Poll devices
	- via `Get-GoveeDevice`
- [X] Poll device state
	- via `Get-GoveeDeviceState`
- [X] Set device power state
	- via `Set-GoveeDeviceState`
- [ ] Set other device states
- [ ] Convert to class-based implementation
- [ ] Add provisions for event subscription
